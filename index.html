      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>I'm Efe Berk Ural, a high school student at UMC High School with a strong passion for software development — especially in the field of game development. Ever since I started coding, I've been driven by the idea of creating digital worlds that are not only fun but also meaningful. I recently developed a simple Bubble Shot game using Python, and it sparked a deeper interest in building interactive and engaging experiences. My goal is to study Computer Engineering at university and pursue a career as a game developer, combining creativity with technology. Outside of coding, I enjoy playing electric guitar, exploring financial markets, and gaming — all of which fuel my curiosity and creative thinking. I'm always open to learning, collaboration, and connecting with others who share the same passion for technology and innovation.</p>
